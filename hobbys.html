        	<p class="pPur">I, Kira yoshikage enjoy simpler things in life such as Putting disrespectful people in their place. Althought sometimes you can't help it, alot of things in life you cant help. Is it wrong to give in to your desires? I dont' really care honestly. All i care about is living my nice quiet life. Oh! sorry for me rambling, Like most things i cant help it. Now what was i talking about again? Ah yes, the simpler things in life like peace, happiness, and .....<p>

            <p class="pPur">Another hobby i have is to keep my nails nicely clipped and measure their lengths and rate of growth. Long fast nail growing means im under alot of stress and thats just no good. If only there were a way to deal with said stress.</p>

            <p class="pPur">My last hobby involves releasing all of my pent up stress from the week. What is this hobby you ask? Why, its the only way for me to live my quiet peaceful life. I simple blow people up with my stand ability killer queen and keep their hands till they rot. Only the best hands of course.</p>
